<h6> npm i nodemon</h6>

Nodemon is a development tool that automatically restarts a Node.js application when file changes in the directory are detected. It helps streamline the development process by eliminating the need to manually stop and restart the server every time code changes are made. Here are some key features:

Automatic Restarts: Monitors your project files and restarts the server whenever it detects changes.
Easy Integration: Simple to install and use, typically with a command like nodemon app.js instead of node app.js.
Customization: Allows configuration to specify which files or directories to watch, which extensions to watch, and other options through a nodemon.json file or command-line arguments.
Compatibility: Works with any Node.js application and can be integrated with other tools and frameworks........
